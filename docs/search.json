Naples (Italy) & MIT (USA).\nProfessorate: Assistant & Associate Professor at Boise State University (2017-2025).\nCurrently: Back home at UT Dallas as Associate Professor of Systems Engineering.\n\n\n \n\n\n\nI’ve been around! I started in Turkey, did my PhD here at UTD, and then spent time in Italy and MIT.\nI spent the last 9 years at Boise State where I built my research lab and received tenure.\nI’m thrilled to be back at UTD starting this semester!"
